  <!-- Note: These permissions are also set up in the rolemap.xml GenericSetup
             importer in CMFPlone.

      Portlet add and edit forms, as well as move/delete operations are
      actually protected by the less secure ManageOwnPortlets, with additional
      checks in the view. This is annoying, but it becomes very hard to
      manage security properly for the dashboard otherwise.

      These checks are made using an IPortletPermissionChecker adapter.

      A better way of doing this would probably be to use the Owner role
      against the assignment mappings and let Manage portlets be controlled
      by that, but managing those roles properly w.r.t. the namespace
      traversal adapters and acquisition is not fun.
